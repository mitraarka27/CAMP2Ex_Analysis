# CAMP2Ex_Analysis
CAMP2Ex was a field campaign in the Philippines that studied cloud and radiation properties from airborne and ship-based multi-sensor suite. Here's a sample of some data analysis I did for this project.

The APR3 analysis reads reads the Ze and velocity data from the native flights, aircraft flight parameters and plots the cross-section plots and allows users to choose suitable durations of the plots. It also carves out the horizontal extent of clouds along the path of the aircraft. This code is automated to do the analysis over each data file without re-adjusting parameters. 

For Research Flight 07 from CAMP2Ex, which sampled a remarkable cold pool case with satellite overpass of NASA's Terra, I compared the cloud-top wind and heights from the MISR instrument on Terra with data from the multi-instrument suite of the CAMP2Ex sensors. The code is available and the results are summarized in the PDF attached.
